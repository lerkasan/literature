Here is a short list of other common possible permissions that users can enjoy.

    ALL PRIVILEGES- as we saw previously, this would allow a MySQL user all access to a designated database (or if no database is selected, across the system)
    CREATE- allows them to create new tables or databases
    DROP- allows them to them to delete tables or databases
    DELETE- allows them to delete rows from tables
    INSERT- allows them to insert rows into tables
    SELECT- allows them to use the Select command to read through databases
    UPDATE- allow them to update table rows
    GRANT OPTION- allows them to grant or remove other users' privileges

To provide a specific user with a permission, you can use this framework:

 GRANT [type of permission] ON [database name].[table name] TO ‘[username]’@'localhost’;

If you want to give them access to any database or to any table, make sure to put an asterisk (*) in the place of the database name or table name.

Each time you update or change a permission be sure to use the Flush Privileges command.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
